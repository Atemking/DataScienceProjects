Project Title : ANALYSE SUPERMARKET DATA ACROSS THE COUNTRY FOR COMPANY XYZ USING PANDAS ANALYTIC

  I use pandas analytics to analyse a supermarket data which have branches accross three major cities
  in the country. 

Project Steps :

  I was provided three seperate csv document to analyse from the three different branches of the supermarket 
  XYZ. I used anaconda for this project and I started by reading all the csv document provided and presented it
  into one large csv file . 
  After reading all through the file, i created a dataframe which stored all the csv document which i had read 
  from the directory which they were been stored. 
  Next i proceeded by doing some analysis on them by making sure they were all read and concatenated properly. 
  The Date and time format in the dataframe was not in datetime format. so i had to convert them to date time format
  and after that, i had to seperate the hours, minute, seconds in each column. 
  After that, I had to fine keys with unique records on the dataset. after i got all the keys having unique records 
  on the dataset , I proceeded by by grouping each of the unique keys base on the task which i had to compute . 
   
  I then analyse each of this unique keys which i got from the original dataframe by grouping each respectively and 
  analysing it before plotting it using seaborn. i mostly used countplot and catplot for this project. 
  
Insights :

  I had allot of difficulties when i was working  with the glob function which i imported , but i successfully got it right.
  I also face allot of difficulties working the datetime format , as it was quite trickish getting the Hour , minutes , second
  because i realise after some analyses. the time was showing me it type as an object , which i could not index to return the 
  corresponding information which i needed. But after allot of reasearch i successfully got it right. 
  
Future Work :
  
  I am looking at doing this same project using R programing.
